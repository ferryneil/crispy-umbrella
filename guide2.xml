    <title lang="en">40 Years a Prisoner</title>
    <desc lang="en">In 1978, the escalating conflict between Philadelphia leadership and the Black liberation group MOVE led to one of the most controversial police shootouts in American historyand a son's four-decade-long fight to free his parents. The 1978 confrontation, which claimed the life of Officer James Ramp and saw unarmed MOVE member Delbert Africa nearly beaten to death, made headlines and culminated in murder charges and prison sentences of 30 to 100 years for nine MOVE members. This timely documentary chronicles the tireless fight by Mike Africa Jr., despite countless setbacks, to ensure the release of his parents and other MOVE members while illuminating the injustice under Police Commissioner-turned-Mayor Frank Rizzo and the media's role in exacerbating the conflict.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Ford v Ferrari</title>
    <desc lang="en">It was a rivalry that could only be settled on the racetrack. In one corner was the mighty master of speed, Ferrari; in the other was an American upstart, Ford. Matt Damon stars as master car builder Carroll Shelby who is tasked by Ford to craft a car that can defeat Ferrari in one of world's most grueling races: the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Christian Bale co-stars as the volatile, but fearless driver Ken Miles who Shelby feels must be behind the wheel. Together, they must overcome personal demons, corporate meddling and ferocious competition to achieve their goal. "A full-bodied and exciting true-life story in which the men behind the wheels are just as dynamic as the machines they drive" (The Hollywood Reporter). Nominated for four Oscars(R), the film won for Best Sound Editing and Best Film Editing. Co-starring Jon Bernthal, Caitriona Balfe, Tracy Letts and Josh Lucas. Directed by James Mangold; written by Jez Butterworth &amp; John-Henry Butterworth and Jason Keller.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">40 Years a Prisoner</title>
    <desc lang="en">In 1978, the escalating conflict between Philadelphia leadership and the Black liberation group MOVE led to one of the most controversial police shootouts in American historyand a son's four-decade-long fight to free his parents. The 1978 confrontation, which claimed the life of Officer James Ramp and saw unarmed MOVE member Delbert Africa nearly beaten to death, made headlines and culminated in murder charges and prison sentences of 30 to 100 years for nine MOVE members. This timely documentary chronicles the tireless fight by Mike Africa Jr., despite countless setbacks, to ensure the release of his parents and other MOVE members while illuminating the injustice under Police Commissioner-turned-Mayor Frank Rizzo and the media's role in exacerbating the conflict.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">40 Years a Prisoner</title>
    <desc lang="en">In 1978, the escalating conflict between Philadelphia leadership and the Black liberation group MOVE led to one of the most controversial police shootouts in American historyand a son's four-decade-long fight to free his parents. The 1978 confrontation, which claimed the life of Officer James Ramp and saw unarmed MOVE member Delbert Africa nearly beaten to death, made headlines and culminated in murder charges and prison sentences of 30 to 100 years for nine MOVE members. This timely documentary chronicles the tireless fight by Mike Africa Jr., despite countless setbacks, to ensure the release of his parents and other MOVE members while illuminating the injustice under Police Commissioner-turned-Mayor Frank Rizzo and the media's role in exacerbating the conflict.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">40 Years a Prisoner</title>
    <desc lang="en">In 1978, the escalating conflict between Philadelphia leadership and the Black liberation group MOVE led to one of the most controversial police shootouts in American historyand a son's four-decade-long fight to free his parents. The 1978 confrontation, which claimed the life of Officer James Ramp and saw unarmed MOVE member Delbert Africa nearly beaten to death, made headlines and culminated in murder charges and prison sentences of 30 to 100 years for nine MOVE members. This timely documentary chronicles the tireless fight by Mike Africa Jr., despite countless setbacks, to ensure the release of his parents and other MOVE members while illuminating the injustice under Police Commissioner-turned-Mayor Frank Rizzo and the media's role in exacerbating the conflict.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">We Bought a Zoo</title>
    <desc lang="en">Widower Matt Damon comes up with a unique plan to lift his family out of their collective funk: by purchasing a ramshackle zoo. From director Cameron Crowe ('Almost Famous') comes this "enchanting" (New York magazine) tale that follows Benjamin Mee (Damon) and his two children--one a seven-year-old sweet pea, the other a brooding teen--as they try to start a new life in a place populated by wild animals and an equally quirky staff. Scarlett Johansson co-stars as the property's attractive zookeeper. Also with Thomas Haden Church, Patrick Fugit, Elle Fanning and John Michael Higgins. Directed by Cameron Crowe; screenplay by Aline Brosh McKenna and Cameron Crowe, based upon the book by Benjamin Mee. (PG) (AL,MV).(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In 1978, the escalating conflict between Philadelphia leadership and the Black liberation group MOVE led to one of the most controversial police shootouts in American historyand a son's four-decade-long fight to free his parents. The 1978 confrontation, which claimed the life of Officer James Ramp and saw unarmed MOVE member Delbert Africa nearly beaten to death, made headlines and culminated in murder charges and prison sentences of 30 to 100 years for nine MOVE members. This timely documentary chronicles the tireless fight by Mike Africa Jr., despite countless setbacks, to ensure the release of his parents and other MOVE members while illuminating the injustice under Police Commissioner-turned-Mayor Frank Rizzo and the media's role in exacerbating the conflict.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Fahrenheit 451</title>
    <desc lang="en">Ray Bradbury's classic novel is infused with a decidedly 21st century sensibility in this dazzling, high-tech thriller. In an American future where the media is an opiate, internet bots control routines, history is truncated or rewritten, and celebrity "firemen" engage in televised search-and-destroy missions to burn books and bring their owners to justice, one zealous fireman begins to question his long-held assumptions about his life's work. Michael B. Jordan stars as the fireman who has been groomed to replace his captain (Michael Shannon). After meeting a young informant (Sofia Boutella), the fireman makes a dangerous decision to assist a group of underground "Eels" in their plan to preserve the contents of thousands of classic books, arts and culture. Directed by Ramin Bahrani; written by Ramin Bahrani &amp; Amir Naderi.(n)</desc>

Formerly a renowned Nevada fertility specialist, he has become best known for deceiving countless women struggling to conceive by using his own sperm--without their knowledge or consent--to impregnate them. Featuring intimate and revealing interviews with many of Fortier's children, the film takes a close, nuanced look at the lasting effects that Fortier's misdeeds have had--and will continue to have--on the women he victimized, as well as their children and generations to come. The result is a stunning expose of the egregious, once undetectable truths about Fortier's medical practice, as well as his alleged sexual abuse of family members.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Comedian and actress Yvonne Orji (HBO's "Insecure") takes the stage in this special taped in front of a live audience at the Howard Theatre, just blocks away from Howard University Hospital, where Yvonne's mom practiced as a nurse for 27 years. Interspersed with vibrant, personal footage shot in Nigeria  Yvonne's native home  during a milestone trip in early January, the show takes an intimate, hilarious look at what being Nigerian-American means to Yvonne  from her international haggling addiction; to having her phone tapped by her parents as a kid; to the fine line between cursing people out and putting curses on them.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In 1978, the escalating conflict between Philadelphia leadership and the Black liberation group MOVE led to one of the most controversial police shootouts in American historyand a son's four-decade-long fight to free his parents. The 1978 confrontation, which claimed the life of Officer James Ramp and saw unarmed MOVE member Delbert Africa nearly beaten to death, made headlines and culminated in murder charges and prison sentences of 30 to 100 years for nine MOVE members. This timely documentary chronicles the tireless fight by Mike Africa Jr., despite countless setbacks, to ensure the release of his parents and other MOVE members while illuminating the injustice under Police Commissioner-turned-Mayor Frank Rizzo and the media's role in exacerbating the conflict.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Alabama Snake</title>
    <desc lang="en">It's a chilling Southern Gothic tale of an attempted murder by rattlesnake. This documentary explores the mystifying events leading up to October 4, 1991, when an unusual violent crime was reported in Scottsboro, Alabama: Darlene Summerford accused her husband, Pentecostal preacher Glenn Summerford, of forcing her hand into a rattlesnake bed in an attempt to kill her. Employing dramatic re-creations and interviews with those who knew Summerford best, the documentary weaves between the past and present to unravel the details of the controversial investigation and trial that unfolded.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">It's a chilling Southern Gothic tale of an attempted murder by rattlesnake. This documentary explores the mystifying events leading up to October 4, 1991, when an unusual violent crime was reported in Scottsboro, Alabama: Darlene Summerford accused her husband, Pentecostal preacher Glenn Summerford, of forcing her hand into a rattlesnake bed in an attempt to kill her. Employing dramatic re-creations and interviews with those who knew Summerford best, the documentary weaves between the past and present to unravel the details of the controversial investigation and trial that unfolded.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">40 Years a Prisoner</title>
    <desc lang="en">In 1978, the escalating conflict between Philadelphia leadership and the Black liberation group MOVE led to one of the most controversial police shootouts in American historyand a son's four-decade-long fight to free his parents. The 1978 confrontation, which claimed the life of Officer James Ramp and saw unarmed MOVE member Delbert Africa nearly beaten to death, made headlines and culminated in murder charges and prison sentences of 30 to 100 years for nine MOVE members. This timely documentary chronicles the tireless fight by Mike Africa Jr., despite countless setbacks, to ensure the release of his parents and other MOVE members while illuminating the injustice under Police Commissioner-turned-Mayor Frank Rizzo and the media's role in exacerbating the conflict.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">40 Years a Prisoner</title>
    <desc lang="en">In 1978, the escalating conflict between Philadelphia leadership and the Black liberation group MOVE led to one of the most controversial police shootouts in American historyand a son's four-decade-long fight to free his parents. The 1978 confrontation, which claimed the life of Officer James Ramp and saw unarmed MOVE member Delbert Africa nearly beaten to death, made headlines and culminated in murder charges and prison sentences of 30 to 100 years for nine MOVE members. This timely documentary chronicles the tireless fight by Mike Africa Jr., despite countless setbacks, to ensure the release of his parents and other MOVE members while illuminating the injustice under Police Commissioner-turned-Mayor Frank Rizzo and the media's role in exacerbating the conflict.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Widower Matt Damon comes up with a unique plan to lift his family out of their collective funk: by purchasing a ramshackle zoo. From director Cameron Crowe ('Almost Famous') comes this "enchanting" (New York magazine) tale that follows Benjamin Mee (Damon) and his two children--one a seven-year-old sweet pea, the other a brooding teen--as they try to start a new life in a place populated by wild animals and an equally quirky staff. Scarlett Johansson co-stars as the property's attractive zookeeper. Also with Thomas Haden Church, Patrick Fugit, Elle Fanning and John Michael Higgins. Directed by Cameron Crowe; screenplay by Aline Brosh McKenna and Cameron Crowe, based upon the book by Benjamin Mee. (PG) (AL,MV).(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Once hailed as a miracle worker, Dr. Quincy Fortier's secret is now out. Formerly a renowned Nevada fertility specialist, he has become best known for deceiving countless women struggling to conceive by using his own sperm--without their knowledge or consent--to impregnate them. Featuring intimate and revealing interviews with many of Fortier's children, the film takes a close, nuanced look at the lasting effects that Fortier's misdeeds have had--and will continue to have--on the women he victimized, as well as their children and generations to come. The result is a stunning expose of the egregious, once undetectable truths about Fortier's medical practice, as well as his alleged sexual abuse of family members.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">40 Years a Prisoner</title>
    <desc lang="en">In 1978, the escalating conflict between Philadelphia leadership and the Black liberation group MOVE led to one of the most controversial police shootouts in American historyand a son's four-decade-long fight to free his parents. The 1978 confrontation, which claimed the life of Officer James Ramp and saw unarmed MOVE member Delbert Africa nearly beaten to death, made headlines and culminated in murder charges and prison sentences of 30 to 100 years for nine MOVE members. This timely documentary chronicles the tireless fight by Mike Africa Jr., despite countless setbacks, to ensure the release of his parents and other MOVE members while illuminating the injustice under Police Commissioner-turned-Mayor Frank Rizzo and the media's role in exacerbating the conflict.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Fahrenheit 451</title>
    <desc lang="en">Ray Bradbury's classic novel is infused with a decidedly 21st century sensibility in this dazzling, high-tech thriller. In an American future where the media is an opiate, internet bots control routines, history is truncated or rewritten, and celebrity "firemen" engage in televised search-and-destroy missions to burn books and bring their owners to justice, one zealous fireman begins to question his long-held assumptions about his life's work. Michael B. Jordan stars as the fireman who has been groomed to replace his captain (Michael Shannon). After meeting a young informant (Sofia Boutella), the fireman makes a dangerous decision to assist a group of underground "Eels" in their plan to preserve the contents of thousands of classic books, arts and culture. Directed by Ramin Bahrani; written by Ramin Bahrani &amp; Amir Naderi.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Something Borrowed</title>
    <desc lang="en">There's a fine line between love and friendship, but for a New York City attorney, that line becomes a precarious tightrope. Darcy (Kate Hudson) and Rachel (Ginnifer Goodwin) have been friends since childhood, but their bond is about to be put to the test after Rachel hooks up with Darcy's fiancee (and Rachel's old classmate) Dex just two months before their wedding. With guilt pulling her one way and her attraction to Dex in the other (and the wedding fast approaching), Rachel must decide between true love with Dex or her lifelong friendship with Darcy. John Krasinski, Colin Egglesfield, Steve Howey, Ashley Williams, Geoff Pierson and Jill Eikenberry co-star in this humorous and moving romantic comedy. Directed by Luke Greenfield; screenplay by Jennie Snyder Urman, based on the novel by Emily Griffin. (PG13) ().(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Big Year</title>
    <desc lang="en">Life goes to the birds--literally--for a trio of obsessed avian enthusiasts in this comedy starring Jack Black, Steve Martin and Owen Wilson. For devoted 'birders,' doing a Big Year is the ultimate quest: an informal competition to see or hear as many species as possible in a year. For Brad Harris (Black) and Stu Preissler (Martin), it's the culmination of a lifelong love of birding. But when reigning record-holder Kenny Bostick (Wilson) gets wind of their efforts, he takes the competition to fanatical new heights, leading the three on a comical circuit of America in search of warblers, woodpeckers, sapsuckers, and everything in between. Brian Dennehy, Anjelica Huston, Rashida Jones, Rosamund Pike, Dianne Wiest and Jobeth Williams co-star. Directed by David Frankel, screenplay by Howard Franklin. (PG) (MV).(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Lil Rel Howery: Live in Crenshaw</title>
    <desc lang="en">Comedian, actor, writer and producer Lil Rel Howery performs before a live audience at a high school in Los Angeles in this stand-up special. Known for his well-crafted storytelling and hilarious impressions of the myriad characters he encounters in life, Howery draws on his personal experiences in his relatable, very funny performance as he tells the ins-and-outs of returning to his hometown of Chicago for his uncle's funeral and being told that it's "his turn" to pay for the funeral since he's so successful, and the experience of taking a bus to Mississippi with his grandmother. He also touches on such subjects as the frustrations of automated customer service reps, getting asked if he knows famous people, the things he's learned about women from having a daughter, turning 40, and more.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In 1978, the escalating conflict between Philadelphia leadership and the Black liberation group MOVE led to one of the most controversial police shootouts in American historyand a son's four-decade-long fight to free his parents. The 1978 confrontation, which claimed the life of Officer James Ramp and saw unarmed MOVE member Delbert Africa nearly beaten to death, made headlines and culminated in murder charges and prison sentences of 30 to 100 years for nine MOVE members. This timely documentary chronicles the tireless fight by Mike Africa Jr., despite countless setbacks, to ensure the release of his parents and other MOVE members while illuminating the injustice under Police Commissioner-turned-Mayor Frank Rizzo and the media's role in exacerbating the conflict.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Once hailed as a miracle worker, Dr. Quincy Fortier's secret is now out. Formerly a renowned Nevada fertility specialist, he has become best known for deceiving countless women struggling to conceive by using his own sperm--without their knowledge or consent--to impregnate them. Featuring intimate and revealing interviews with many of Fortier's children, the film takes a close, nuanced look at the lasting effects that Fortier's misdeeds have had--and will continue to have--on the women he victimized, as well as their children and generations to come. The result is a stunning expose of the egregious, once undetectable truths about Fortier's medical practice, as well as his alleged sexual abuse of family members.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Once hailed as a miracle worker, Dr. Quincy Fortier's secret is now out. Formerly a renowned Nevada fertility specialist, he has become best known for deceiving countless women struggling to conceive by using his own sperm--without their knowledge or consent--to impregnate them. Featuring intimate and revealing interviews with many of Fortier's children, the film takes a close, nuanced look at the lasting effects that Fortier's misdeeds have had--and will continue to have--on the women he victimized, as well as their children and generations to come. The result is a stunning expose of the egregious, once undetectable truths about Fortier's medical practice, as well as his alleged sexual abuse of family members.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">40 Years a Prisoner</title>
    <desc lang="en">In 1978, the escalating conflict between Philadelphia leadership and the Black liberation group MOVE led to one of the most controversial police shootouts in American historyand a son's four-decade-long fight to free his parents. The 1978 confrontation, which claimed the life of Officer James Ramp and saw unarmed MOVE member Delbert Africa nearly beaten to death, made headlines and culminated in murder charges and prison sentences of 30 to 100 years for nine MOVE members. This timely documentary chronicles the tireless fight by Mike Africa Jr., despite countless setbacks, to ensure the release of his parents and other MOVE members while illuminating the injustice under Police Commissioner-turned-Mayor Frank Rizzo and the media's role in exacerbating the conflict.(n)</desc>

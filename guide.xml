    <desc lang="nl">Edwin van der Sar wordt op 29 oktober 50 jaar, een mooi moment om terug te blikken op zijn imposante carrière en persoonlijke leven. Natuurlijk komt Edwin zelf ruim aan het woord. Daarnaast ook interviews zijn vrouw Annemarie en hun kinderen Joe en Lynn, zijn vader Rien, Louis van Gaal, Edwins ontdekker Ruud Bröring, Frank en Ronald de Boer en Rio Ferdinand. We bespreken Edwins jeugd, zijn stap van Noordwijk naar het grote Ajax, de successen uit de jaren ‘90, zijn buitenlandse periodes bij Juventus, Fulham en natuurlijk Manchester United. Ook zien we een meer persoonlijke kant van Edwin, hoe zijn leven thuis is en praten we over de impact die de hersenbloeding van Annemarie had op hun leven. Na deze periode werd de De Edwin van der Sar Foundation hebben opgezet die zich inzet voor mensen die te maken hebben gehad met hersenletsel. En natuurlijk wordt er ingezoomd op zijn werk als Algemeen Directeur van AFC Ajax.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="nl">In 1997 debuteert Feyenoord in de Champions League in een sterke poule met FC Kosice, Manchester United en Juventus. In speelronde vijf ontvangt het dan uitgeschakelde Feyenoord de Italiaanse grootmacht. De verwachtingen zijn niet hoog na een eerdere oorwassing in Turijn, een moeizaam competieverloop en het ontslag van trainer Arie Haan. Leo Beenhakker stapt in en krijgt in een korte periode de boel weer op de rails voordat Juventus naar De Kuip komt. Een duel van prestige en eerherstel bij Het Legioen en ook de wedstrijd van Julio Cruz. Bijna twintig jaar na dato blikt hij in Buenos Aires terug op zijn bevrijdende doelpunten.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="nl">AZ verovert Europa</sub-title>
    <desc lang="nl">AZ beleeft in het seizoen 2004-2005 een mooi Europees avontuur. In de UEFA Cup eindigt de club glansrijk als eerste in een groep met onder meer Auxerre en Glasgow Rangers. Daarna groeit het elftal van Co Adriaanse in het toernooi en via Allemania Aachen, Sjachtar Donetsk en Villarreal wordt de halve finale gehaald. Na twee wedstrijden tegen Sporting Portugal staat AZ met anderhalf been in de finale, maar in de extra tijd van de verlenging gaat het alsnog mis. Assistent-coach Martin Haar, aanvoerder Denny Landzaat en directeur Toon Gerbrands blikken terug op een memorabel seizoen. Ook komt supporter Jozef Vermanen aan het woord. Hij reisde AZ dat seizoen op de fiets achterna.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="nl">Edwin van der Sar wordt op 29 oktober 50 jaar, een mooi moment om terug te blikken op zijn imposante carrière en persoonlijke leven. Natuurlijk komt Edwin zelf ruim aan het woord. Daarnaast ook interviews zijn vrouw Annemarie en hun kinderen Joe en Lynn, zijn vader Rien, Louis van Gaal, Edwins ontdekker Ruud Bröring, Frank en Ronald de Boer en Rio Ferdinand. We bespreken Edwins jeugd, zijn stap van Noordwijk naar het grote Ajax, de successen uit de jaren ‘90, zijn buitenlandse periodes bij Juventus, Fulham en natuurlijk Manchester United. Ook zien we een meer persoonlijke kant van Edwin, hoe zijn leven thuis is en praten we over de impact die de hersenbloeding van Annemarie had op hun leven. Na deze periode werd de De Edwin van der Sar Foundation hebben opgezet die zich inzet voor mensen die te maken hebben gehad met hersenletsel. En natuurlijk wordt er ingezoomd op zijn werk als Algemeen Directeur van AFC Ajax.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="nl">Edwin van der Sar wordt op 29 oktober 50 jaar, een mooi moment om terug te blikken op zijn imposante carrière en persoonlijke leven. Natuurlijk komt Edwin zelf ruim aan het woord. Daarnaast ook interviews zijn vrouw Annemarie en hun kinderen Joe en Lynn, zijn vader Rien, Louis van Gaal, Edwins ontdekker Ruud Bröring, Frank en Ronald de Boer en Rio Ferdinand. We bespreken Edwins jeugd, zijn stap van Noordwijk naar het grote Ajax, de successen uit de jaren ‘90, zijn buitenlandse periodes bij Juventus, Fulham en natuurlijk Manchester United. Ook zien we een meer persoonlijke kant van Edwin, hoe zijn leven thuis is en praten we over de impact die de hersenbloeding van Annemarie had op hun leven. Na deze periode werd de De Edwin van der Sar Foundation hebben opgezet die zich inzet voor mensen die te maken hebben gehad met hersenletsel. En natuurlijk wordt er ingezoomd op zijn werk als Algemeen Directeur van AFC Ajax.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="nl">Edwin van der Sar wordt op 29 oktober 50 jaar, een mooi moment om terug te blikken op zijn imposante carrière en persoonlijke leven. Natuurlijk komt Edwin zelf ruim aan het woord. Daarnaast ook interviews zijn vrouw Annemarie en hun kinderen Joe en Lynn, zijn vader Rien, Louis van Gaal, Edwins ontdekker Ruud Bröring, Frank en Ronald de Boer en Rio Ferdinand. We bespreken Edwins jeugd, zijn stap van Noordwijk naar het grote Ajax, de successen uit de jaren ‘90, zijn buitenlandse periodes bij Juventus, Fulham en natuurlijk Manchester United. Ook zien we een meer persoonlijke kant van Edwin, hoe zijn leven thuis is en praten we over de impact die de hersenbloeding van Annemarie had op hun leven. Na deze periode werd de De Edwin van der Sar Foundation hebben opgezet die zich inzet voor mensen die te maken hebben gehad met hersenletsel. En natuurlijk wordt er ingezoomd op zijn werk als Algemeen Directeur van AFC Ajax.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="nl">In 1997 debuteert Feyenoord in de Champions League in een sterke poule met FC Kosice, Manchester United en Juventus. In speelronde vijf ontvangt het dan uitgeschakelde Feyenoord de Italiaanse grootmacht. De verwachtingen zijn niet hoog na een eerdere oorwassing in Turijn, een moeizaam competieverloop en het ontslag van trainer Arie Haan. Leo Beenhakker stapt in en krijgt in een korte periode de boel weer op de rails voordat Juventus naar De Kuip komt. Een duel van prestige en eerherstel bij Het Legioen en ook de wedstrijd van Julio Cruz. Bijna twintig jaar na dato blikt hij in Buenos Aires terug op zijn bevrijdende doelpunten.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="nl">In 1997 debuteert Feyenoord in de Champions League in een sterke poule met FC Kosice, Manchester United en Juventus. In speelronde vijf ontvangt het dan uitgeschakelde Feyenoord de Italiaanse grootmacht. De verwachtingen zijn niet hoog na een eerdere oorwassing in Turijn, een moeizaam competieverloop en het ontslag van trainer Arie Haan. Leo Beenhakker stapt in en krijgt in een korte periode de boel weer op de rails voordat Juventus naar De Kuip komt. Een duel van prestige en eerherstel bij Het Legioen en ook de wedstrijd van Julio Cruz. Bijna twintig jaar na dato blikt hij in Buenos Aires terug op zijn bevrijdende doelpunten.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="nl">AZ beleeft in het seizoen 2004-2005 een mooi Europees avontuur. In de UEFA Cup eindigt de club glansrijk als eerste in een groep met onder meer Auxerre en Glasgow Rangers. Daarna groeit het elftal van Co Adriaanse in het toernooi en via Allemania Aachen, Sjachtar Donetsk en Villarreal wordt de halve finale gehaald. Na twee wedstrijden tegen Sporting Portugal staat AZ met anderhalf been in de finale, maar in de extra tijd van de verlenging gaat het alsnog mis. Assistent-coach Martin Haar, aanvoerder Denny Landzaat en directeur Toon Gerbrands blikken terug op een memorabel seizoen. Ook komt supporter Jozef Vermanen aan het woord. Hij reisde AZ dat seizoen op de fiets achterna.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="nl">Edwin van der Sar wordt op 29 oktober 50 jaar, een mooi moment om terug te blikken op zijn imposante carrière en persoonlijke leven. Natuurlijk komt Edwin zelf ruim aan het woord. Daarnaast ook interviews zijn vrouw Annemarie en hun kinderen Joe en Lynn, zijn vader Rien, Louis van Gaal, Edwins ontdekker Ruud Bröring, Frank en Ronald de Boer en Rio Ferdinand. We bespreken Edwins jeugd, zijn stap van Noordwijk naar het grote Ajax, de successen uit de jaren ‘90, zijn buitenlandse periodes bij Juventus, Fulham en natuurlijk Manchester United. Ook zien we een meer persoonlijke kant van Edwin, hoe zijn leven thuis is en praten we over de impact die de hersenbloeding van Annemarie had op hun leven. Na deze periode werd de De Edwin van der Sar Foundation hebben opgezet die zich inzet voor mensen die te maken hebben gehad met hersenletsel. En natuurlijk wordt er ingezoomd op zijn werk als Algemeen Directeur van AFC Ajax.(n)</desc>

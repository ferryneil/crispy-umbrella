        <desc lang="en">In the year 1750, England is rife with crime and highway robbers. To stop the wave of chaos, King George sets up the first professional police force named the Bow Street Runners, under the command of the bellowing Sir Roger Daley (Bernard Bresslaw), and seconded by Captain Desmond Fancey (Kenneth Williams) and Sergeant Jock Strapp (Jack Douglas (actor)). The Runners are apparently successful in wiping out crime and lawlessness – using all manner of traps and tricks to round the criminals up. However their main target is the notorious Richard "Big Dick" Turpin (Sid James), a highwayman who has evaded capture and succeeded in even robbing Sir Roger and his prim wife (Margaret Nolan) of their money and clothing. After this humiliation, Turpin becomes the Bow Street Runners' most wanted man, and thus Captain Fancey is assigned to go undercover and catch the famous Dick Turpin and bring him to justice.</desc>

When he asks Max about Terry's last whereabouts, she insists on coming along, despite his protests. Meanwhile, Batman wakes up in an underground tunnel under the hostile glare of a young boy, a runaway who lives in the tunnels. The boy wants Batman off of his turf as soon as possible, and tries to help him leave.

It turns out that the suspicious figure is none other than Shriek's assistant, who is helping the twisted sound genius with his new plan. Shriek causes a cave-in to trap Batman and the boy, who starts to express his long-standing hostility toward Batman. As Max and Bruce work toward finding Terry, and Batman and the boy try to escape, each learns to appreciate the others' skills -- until Shriek reveals himself from the shadows.</desc>

        <desc lang="en">Terry becomes suspicious when his biology teacher starts acting oddly. The strange behavior culminates in a manic chase and shootout with federal agents after school, leading him to get involved as Batman. When Commissioner Gordon and her men find the teacher gagged and bound in her home, the truth comes out: an intelligent synthoid code-named Zeta is on the loose. Designed for stealth and assassination, it has the ability to disguise itself as any person using a holographic generator.

Batman joins in the hunt for Zeta, but when he corners the robot he discovers that Zeta ran away from the federal agency because he doesn't want to kill. Gary Cole makes his first and only appearance as the voice of Zeta, before Diedrich Bader assumed the role for the Zeta Project spin-off series. Joe Spano makes his first appearance as agent Bennet.</desc>

Fed up with Terry, who she sees as a hothead, Commissioner Gordon warns Bruce that she'll be keeping an eye on him to make sure he doesn't get into more trouble. Her worst fears are realized soon enough when she sees Batman bludgeoning Mad Stan to death with one of his own bombs.

When Terry returns home, he finds the Commissioner's men looking for him, but he doesn't know why. Fleeing to Max's house, he tries to understand: how could people have witnessed him perpetrating a crime he didn't commit?</desc>

        <desc lang="en">Terry's Family Studies teacher gives the class an assignment: to learn about the responsibilities of parenthood, they have to take care of an egg. The familiar exercise is given a high-tech twist -- each "eggbaby" has sensors which register the amount of care it receives and a computerized feedback system causes it to coo, cry, and giggle like a real baby.

When Terry's assignment partner, vain cheerleader Blade Summers, unceremoniously dumps the eggbaby on him, he's forced to carry it with him when he's out as Batman -- even while chasing the notorious Ma Mayhem and her gang as they commit a series of daring ruby thefts.</desc>

To save himself, he sells off all of his Gray Ghost merchandise. Immediately afterwards, a series of crimes related to the old show begin to occur. Batman, having himself been inspired partly by the show to become the crimefighter he now is, goes to Trent for help, and they team up to put an end to the crimes. 

In this episode, the voice of Simon Trent is none other than Adam West, the man who played Batman in the 1960's version of Batman</desc>

Connolly almost ventured into English territory at the end of the fifth episode when he cycled past the "Scotland" sign in Roxburgh. "I've come a bit far here, I believe," he says, after screeching his bike to a halt. "And me out without my passport. It is a Scottish tour, after all. One thing confuses me, however," he continued, as he prepared to retrace his route. "If this is the border with England, and this is the border with Scotland, what happens in [between]? Maybe it's owned by the Manx government, or something. I don't know. Perhaps you can build a house here and never pay tax again."</desc>

This evocative film navigates Jobs' path from a small house in the suburbs, to zen temples in Japan, to the CEO's office of the world's richest company, exploring how Jobs’ life and work shaped our relationship with the computer. The Man in the Machine is a provocative and sometimes startling re-evaluation of the legacy of an icon.</desc>

        <desc lang="en">In 1994, journalist Enza Massa visited the Italian National Library in Rome. While she was researching old texts, Enza discovered a book titled "NOSTRADAMUS VATICANICA CODE", dating back to 1629. And the author of the book, as written inside, was "Michel de Notredame". The book contained many vivid paintings and cryptic messages. This TV Documentary follows the investigation of how the manuscript came to be found in the archives, and exactly how it got there. With new insights into the life of Nostradamus, his relationship with his family, and political and the religious figures of his time.</desc>

From the World War that began with a gunshot in the Balkans to the feuds of the Appalachians, mountains have also been flashpoints for violence. They provide minerals and metals that make civilization possible, and the water that feeds billions, yet we were never designed to live in their extreme environments. Without mountains earth would be desolate and uninhabitable, and scientists now believe that an invisible mountain range made life possible in the first place.</desc>

While she was researching old texts, Enza discovered a book titled "NOSTRADAMUS VATICANICA CODE", dating back to 1629. And the author of the book, as written inside, was "Michel de Notredame". The book contained many vivid paintings and cryptic messages. This TV Documentary follows the investigation of how the manuscript came to be found in the archives, and exactly how it got there. With new insights into the life of Nostradamus, his relationship with his family, and political and the religious figures of his time.</desc>
